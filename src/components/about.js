                Jonathan has a real knack for balancing the technical and artistic aspects of a project. His work always demonstrates a strong understanding of the real-world sources of his subject while taking enough artistic liberty to make the work compelling. Plus, he’s just a great dude to be around.

                    Every piece of work I've commissioned Jonathan to do has far exceeded my expectations. His creative approach and attention to detail is unmatched in my experience, and he's truly skilled at taking an abstract idea and making it a reality.
